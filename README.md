This repository showcases the projects and tasks completed during the Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship. Each task highlights the application of data analytics techniques for extracting insights, visualizing trends, and supporting data-driven decision-making.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL 1 TASK 1 
Idea: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.

Objectives: Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation). Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques. Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior. Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps. Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.

LEVEL 1 Task 2 Idea: Customer Segmentation Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: The aim of this data analytics project is to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e- commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

Objectives: Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and relevant data. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset, understand its structure, and handle any missing or inconsistent data. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, etc. Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on behavior and purchase patterns. Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer segments. Insights and Recommendations: Analyze characteristics of each segment and provide insights.

LEVEL 1 Task 3 Idea: Cleaning Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Data Cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. Here are some projects to test out your data cleaning skills

Objectives: Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the cleaning process. Missing Data Handling: Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset. Duplicate Removal: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness. Standardization: Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis. Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.

LEVEL 2 Task 1 Idea: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

Objectives: Data Collection: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality. Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model. Model Training: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit- Learn). Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared. Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and actual values.

LEVEL 2 Task 2 Idea: Wine Quality Prediction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.

Objectives: Classifier Models: Utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction. Chemical Qualities: Analyzing features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality. Data Analysis Libraries: Employing Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array operations. Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the dataset

LEVEL 2 Task 3 Idea: Unveiling the Android App Market:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Clean, categorize, and visualize Google Play Store data to understand app market dynamics. Gain in-depth insights into the Android app market by leveraging data analytics, visualization, and enhanced interpretation skills.

Objectives: Data Preparation:Clean and correct data types for accuracy. Category Exploration:Investigate app distribution across categories. Metrics Analysis:Examine app ratings, size, popularity, and pricing trends. Sentiment Analysis:Assess user sentiments through reviews. Interactive Visualization:Utilize code for compelling visualizations. Skill Enhancement:Integrate insights from the "Understanding Data Visualization" course.
